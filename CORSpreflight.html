    <!-- Cross plaform resource sharing  -->
    <!-- Cross is a mecahnism which uses additional http headers to tell the browser 
         wether the specific web app can share resource with another Web App but the
         major important point to note here is both the web apps should have diffrent
         origin .........so suppose if they the same origin they can share resources
         very easily but if they don't have the same origin then they need to follow the
         CORS mechanism 

         LONG BACK when the CORS was not standardzied we never allwoed we apps to share
         resources between diffrent orgins 


  CSRF : cross site request forgery .. example .. modify button while changing the username in http://reversing.kr site but if u take out the source code from
     the FORM tag from the website and put it in your website we can make changes in the http://reversing.kr account without even accessing the account itself
     registered in reversing.kr website ....... this is called Cross site request forgery 
  Same origin policy :
