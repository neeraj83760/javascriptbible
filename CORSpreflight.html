    <!-- Cross plaform resource sharing  -->
    <!-- Cross is a mecahnism which uses additional http headers to tell the browser 
         wether the specific web app can share resource with another Web App but the
         major important point to note here is both the web apps should have diffrent
         origin .........so suppose if they the same origin they can share resources
         very easily but if they don't have the same origin then they need to follow the
         CORS mechanism 

         LONG BACK when the CORS was not standardzied we never allwoed we apps to share
         resources between diffrent orgins 


  CSRF : cross site request forgery .. example .. modify button while changing the username in http://reversing.kr site but if u take out the source code from
     the FORM tag from the website and put it in your website we can make changes in the http://reversing.kr account without even accessing the account itself
     registered in reversing.kr website ....... this is called Cross site request forgery
 
 What is CSRF : It is a web secuirty vulnerablity that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not Intend to perform. It allows an attacker
 to partly circumvent the same origin policy which is designed to prevent diffrent websites from interfering with each other. 


  Same origin policy : bing.com want to acess resources of google.com it will not be able to access it because of same origin policy ...login with facebook or login with 
   google mentioned under the login page of any thirdparty website is possible only because of CORS 


origin A (www.abc.com) __________________ origin B(xyz.com)  if origin A want to useresources of origin B how to CORS works in this case .. Origin A first send the
PRE FLIGHT REQUEST by saying that we need your resources ...then origin B provide an option to A ki bhaiya to jab bhi merese se request karega to ye cheez(Access
-Control-Allow-Origin: www.abc.com) apne header ke andar rakhna ....means if u want to bypass the same origin policy using these kind of features in this CORS helps
