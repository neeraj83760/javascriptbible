    <!-- Cross plaform resource sharing  -->
    <!-- Cross is a mecahnism which uses additional http headers to tell the browser 
         wether the specific web app can share resource with another Web App but the
         major important point to note here is both the web apps should have diffrent
         origin .........so suppose if they the same origin they can share resources
         very easily but if they don't have the same origin then they need to follow the
         CORS mechanism 

         LONG BACK when the CORS was not standardzied we never allwoed we apps to share
         resources between diffrent orgins
