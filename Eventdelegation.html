    <!-- how to event bubbleup in the herrachy in the DOM Tree event delegtion is based on 
    event bubbling so that's why the event bubbling exist event propogation exist 
    -->

    <!-- in our webpage we need event handlers to handle web events on the page but as our 
         application grows the event handlers also grows which sometimes very difficult to 
         manage those handlers it will also impacts our webpage performance so then event delegation
         comes to rescue 
    -->
    <!-- Event delegation says that : Instead of attaching event handlers on the individual
        
        child html elements , we will directly attach the event handler to parent of
        all the child html elements , so suppose someone click on the any of the child element we
        bubble out that event to it's parent and then parent will handle that event  ....

        it will save our time by not attaching the event handler to each and every child element
        and it will also improve performance of the webpage     

    -->
    <!-- <div>
        <ul id="category">
            <li id="laptop">laptops</li>
            <li id="cameras">cameras</li>
            <li id=" shoes">shoes</li>
        </ul>
    </div> -->

    <!-- Suppose we have a lots of input boxes in the html form tag and if any of the inputbox
     has an attribut of "data-uppercase", then any element inside the div which has the 
     "data-uppercase" attribute should follow a functionality. we will filter out those event
    
    -->
    <!-- suppose we want to add a feature to making my name capital means we need the character
         should comeup in uppercase ... suppose we want to acheive that functionality ..
         then at first we check which element have "data-uppercase" arrtibute   
    -->


    <!-- we can also create our ownset of data attribute  -->

    <div id="form">
        <input type="text" id="name" data-uppercase>
        <input type="text" id="pan">
        <input type="text" id="mobilenumber">
    
    </div>
    
    <script>
        // document.querySelector("#category").addEventListener("click",(e)=>{

        //     console.log(e.target.id);

        //     if(e.target.tagName == "LI") // route to a sepecificpage if target element is a "li" element;
        //     window.location.href = "/" + e.target.id;  
        // })

      document.querySelector("#form").addEventListener('keyup',(e)=>{

       console.log(e);

       // filtering out those events which are only specific targeting that data-uppercase elements
       if(e.target.dataset.uppercase != undefined){

        e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase(); 
       }

      })
      // so we have made the above function once but we can reuse this functionality to any number
      // of inputboxes we want to 

      // we saves lots of memory in event delegation because we attach a single eventhandler
      // to the parent component and when the event occur in any of the child compnents we just
      // need to bubble up the event so that the parent to whom we have attached the event handler
      // can handle the event on behalf of child comopnent 

      // Using Event delegation we also write less code because in this we only attach the
      // event handler to the parent element not the child element  

      // third benefit of event delegation is DOM manupulation :

      //  Limitations of Event delegation :

      // All the events don't bubbled up in the herrachy some events like blurr, focus , resizing of the window
      // events like : click, keyup etc bubbled up in the herrachy 
      // please don't use " stoppropogation" method if u want event to bubbled up
