    <!--  Ek webpage pe agar aap ek simple sa bhi operation perform karte ho to
          like clicking on link or any button to poora webpage refresh hota hai
          means utni hi network request dobara jaati hai server ke pass ..

          which is a huge performance issue with any of the website becoz loading the
          whole page again gives poor user exprerience 

          Ajax comes to rescue in this case ...ajax call karne ke liye we have 
          multiple options ,,we use libraries, vanilla javascript, .. most of the 
          people use libraries like Axios which is very famous and poweerful library
