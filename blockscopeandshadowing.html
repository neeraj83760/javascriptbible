        // it shawdowed the ouside value and also modified the outside variable value 
        // because both are pointing to same memory location ... u can also check the same in 
        // debugger tool how "a" modifes the value 100 to 10.....but thats not the case in let keyword


         // let it will keep the outside variable under "script" memory location and the
         // variable inside a block will stay in the block scope ......please check it in the
         // debugger tool for better understanding

        // in a seprate memory space b and c are hoisted and memory assigned 
        // to them ....in the begnning it was assigned to undefined 

        // a is hoisted in a global scope and undefined assigned to it in the begnning 

        // let and const are block scoped because they are not accesible outside 
        // the block ....unlike var


        // what is illegal shadowing

        // If a variable is shadowing something it should not cross the boundary of it's scope
        // in a particualr scope the let cannot be redecalred
