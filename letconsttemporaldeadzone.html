        console.log(b); // b = undefined ... means memory is already been allocated to b because
        // b is hoisted ...also it will be attached to a global object 

        console.log(a); // a = undefined ...it's also hoisted and assigned some meomry under the script
        // section or scope .......but it will not print undefined it will give u an error
        // "can't access a before initaiization " ...but but but but .. it will not be 
        // attached with global object .... it will be kept under script section which 
        // is totally a diffrent meomry space than global 
        
        // Temporal dead zone : it;s a time since when this let varible is hoisted and till 
        // it initialize some value .... the time betweem than is called temporal dead zone

        // to avoid temporal dead zone you need to intialzie and declare the variables 
        //on the top to shrink the temporal dead zone window  

        let a = 10; // once the code reaches to this line the temporal dead zone will end here
        var b = 100;

        // window.b in browser console will give you 100 because it's attached to global object

        // diff between : syntax error , type error, refrence error

            // type err example :

            const c = 100;

            // if we write ......const c; this will give syntax error because const var should be
            // decalred in the same line where it's declared 

            c =1000; // this will throw an err "typeerror : assigment to const vsriable" 
            // type error because c is const type variable 

            // refrence error :
