    <!-- Prototype simply means parent  -->
    <!--  Classes in javascript are just a syntatical sugar or object  -->
    <!--  Calssical inheritance in other programming languages are totally diffrent
          as compare to prototypcal inheritance in the javascript 
    -->

    let a = 10;
    let b = 7; 

    <!-- the above two varialbes are diffrent but dervied from same parent Object which is Object 
    itself you can check the same in the broswer console 
    -->
     
    <!-- let arr = [4,6,7,9]  -->

    <!-- Whenever you create a javascript object javascript engine automatically 
        without even letting you know attaches your object with some hidden 
        properties and functions ....and these are the hidden properties
        and functions which you can access it by just doing arr.push, arr.length etc 

        even bjecta function in javascript attaches with some hidden properties and methods
        by using protypical inheritance 

        keynote : javascript engine attaches an object with your object which having
        hidden properties and methods 

        if you want to access that hidden object which jS engine attaches to your object
        you can write :  arr._proto_ 

        it is same as Array.prototype so,  arr._proto_ === Array.prototype both will
        give you the same result 

        Even _proto_ is an object and each an every object in the javascript 
        has a prototype so arr._proto_ has its own prototype ...means it also has a protptype

        arr._proto_._proto   = this is actually a Object.prototype 

        This means :  Object.protype is also an object so 

        arr._proto_.proto_._proto_ = Null .............

        it;s a sort of a chain 

        arr._proto_ is a Array.prototype and arr._proto_._proto_ is a Object.protoype and 
        
        arr._proto_._proto_._proto_ = Null ...... this is prototype chain

                  city: "Delhi"   
    }
    let obj1 = {name:"neeraj",
                  Age: 30
    }

    // Never do this 
    obj1.__proto__ = obj; // this how obj1 inherits from object
